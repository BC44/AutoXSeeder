# AutoXSeeder
Parses torrent files and creates symlinks for matching local data

Requires [Torrent_Parser](https://pypi.org/project/torrent_parser/)

Set directories corresponding to your working environment inside `AutoXSeeder.py`

This script is intended to be used in a Windows environment

# Setup

edit the .py file and change the values of variables at the top of the python file enclosed by the hash symbol `#`. Since this script is meant for windows, you'll want to add your Windows paths with the backslashes escaped (meaning, for every backslash `\`, you need to prepend it with another backslash). If you copy a path that looks like this: `D:\downloads\downloadspot`, you should input it into the python file as `D:\\downloads\\downloadspot`
